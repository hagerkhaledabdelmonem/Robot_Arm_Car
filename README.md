Robot arm instead of being fixed, it will be moving 
## Description:
The project is often described as mechanical arm looks like a human arm and can rotate in different directions,the most important component that we used to complete the project is
- Node MCU ESP8266
- 2 servo motors instead of 4 for the arm 
- Ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance and stop at a certain distance before hit things  
- DC motor 
- L298N Motor Driver 
- Battery 

it can be controlled by using google assistance and MIT app inventor so it can move things from one place to another.
## Project features :
   - Use google assistance's order as switch so we can do 6 orders from 3 orders
